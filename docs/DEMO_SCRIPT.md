# 10-Minute Demo Script

**Narrative**: "Revenue Leak SRE turns your RevOps team into engineers who strictly monitor and fix revenue reliability."

## Part 1: The Problem (2 mins)
1.  **Open Dashboard**: Start with a blank state.
2.  **Pitch**: "We treat revenue funnel health like site reliability. Just as downtime kills products, 'revenue downtime'—like stale deals and dropped leads—kills growth."
3.  **Concept**: "We introduce Error Budgets for Sales. If you ignore leads, you burn your budget."

## Part 2: Deterministic Demo (3 mins)
1.  **Click "Run Full Demo"** (Purple Button).
    -   *Say*: "Let's simulate a standard Monday morning scan."
2.  **Observe**:
    -   Data loads instantly.
    -   Scan runs.
    -   **Reliability Panel** appears: "Look at the Error Budget. We have 10% budget, but we've burned it down to X% due to slow lead response."
3.  **Top Breaches**: "Here are the top 5 deals bleeding value right now."

## Part 3: The Fix (3 mins)
1.  **Click the Top Issue**: (Likely "Nakatomi Deal" or "Sarah Connor").
2.  **Review Drawer**:
    -   "We see $150k at risk."
    -   "The 'Fix Pack' is auto-generated."
3.  **Preview Fix**:
    -   "Before applying, we see a diff. We are changing ownership to 'Antigravity' and resetting the SLA clock."
4.  **Click "Approve & Apply"**.
    -   *Action*: Toast appears "Success! Slack alert sent."
    -   *Show Audit Log*: Scroll down to the bottom panel. "Every action is immutable and logged."

## Part 4: Chaos Mode (2 mins)
1.  **Click "Inject Chaos"** (Orange Button).
2.  **Scan Again**: "Now we see what happens when 50 bad leads flood the system."
3.  **Conclusion**: "Revenue Leak SRE doesn't just show charts; it acts. It repairs the funnel automatically to keep your Revenue Error Budget green."
